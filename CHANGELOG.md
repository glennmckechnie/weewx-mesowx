# MesoWx Change Log #

## 0.5.2 (2020-06-15) ##

* Add loop_polling_interval to [Mesowx] section. Default is 60 seconds (converts to
    60000 milliseconds for insertion into Config.js) This sets the refresh rate of the
    dashboard (right hand panel on index.html)

    From Config.js
    // the polling interval in milliseconds for the raw real-time data provider
    // this controls how frequently to fetch new data, it should beÂ·
    // set to the frequency that your station generates "LOOP" packets
    Config.realTimePollingInterval = 60000;
* Tidy up / finish unit and format auto configurations from v0.5.1

## 0.5.1 (2020-06-15) ##

* Auto set units according to the configuration found in weewx.conf - US, METRICWX or METRIC

## 0.5.0 (2020-06-14) ##

### Simplify / Automate the install
* Combine the 3 scripts into the one - mesowx.py
* Works with weewx4 and python 3, also with python2.7
* Use the wee_extension installer to perform a (mostly) hands off install of the local setup,
    and minimize the interaction required for the remote install.
* Adjust the script, add tmpl's, use randompassword generator for security key insertion.
* Remote install works with archive and raw, Local works with raw database and weewx database,
    RetainLoopValues remains untested.
