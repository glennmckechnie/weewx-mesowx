[ChartColors]
    # These are the color codes used in Config.js to define the chart lines and
    # the chart names.
    # To change these colors, and have them take affect, you will need to have
    # the skin set to enable in weewx.conf, ie:- under [Mesowx] enable = True
    #
    # One of many ... https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/Web_Safe.html

    # You have 3 choices, only the first enabled one (that is set as true) will
    # be used. If both are false we fall through to the individual values.

    # A boolean switch for whether the chart and min/max stats flags are visible

    # fact permanently on.
    # inTemp on the other hand starts as off; to give a working example of this
    # options affect on the display.

    # If they are changed to false, then their associated min/max stats will be
    # turned off and won't become visible even via the legend toggle.

     # Unless you own a davis station and want to display DayRain, then leave this as is.
