[ChartColors]
    # These are the color codes used in Config.js to define the chart lines and
    # the chart names.
    # To change these colors, and have them take affect, you will need to have
    # the skin set to enable in weewx.conf, ie:- under [Mesowx] enable = True
    #
    # One of many ... https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/Web_Safe.html

    # be used. If both are false we fall through to the individual values.

    # options affect on the display.

    # turned off and won't become visible even via the legend toggle.
